# PowerModelsPrivacyPreserving.jl

PowerModelsPrivacyPreserving.jl is an extension package of PowerModels.jl, to obfuscate values in privacy sensitive (optimal) power flow data sets.


## Core Problem Specifications

- Optimal Power Flow (opf) with maximum load delivery
- OPF with variable branch impedance to obfuscate impedance data

## Core Network Formulations

- AC polar (balanced)


## Network Data Formats

- Matlab ".m" files

**Warning:** This package is under active development and may change drastically without warning.

## Development

Community-driven development and enhancement of PowerModelsPrivacyPreserving are welcome and encouraged. Please develop in a fork or branch of this repo, and launch pull requests to integrate the code into master.
